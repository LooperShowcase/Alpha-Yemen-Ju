      <p> In Swedish, there is a saying that translates to “a beloved child has many names”. I like this expression
          because I am a self-proclaimed maximalist. More is more! But I am bringing this up today because the update
          that is known as Minecraft 1.20 and the 1.20 Update has received a new name! One that is less numerical and 
          a bit more thematic. And that name is… Drumroll please… Even though it’s written in the title of this post… 
          But we love the drama just the same… One more set of ellipses… the Trails & Tales Update!  </p>
          <p>The name was first announced in our premiere episode of Minecraft Monthly, our new news show! Watch the 
            full episode on our YouTube channel and keep your eye out each month for the latest updates delivered by 
            our very own Vu Bui.</p>

               delivered by our very own Vu Bui.</p>
              <p>   Previous updates like Caves & Cliffs and Update Aquatic have been named after a theme, and Trails &
                    Tales is no different. The name represents the journey that Minecraft takes us on, and the unique
                    stories that each of us bring back. Sometimes, that journey is literal, like riding towards the 
                    horizon on a camel with your best friend. Other times, it’s more metaphorical, like learning how
                    to evade hostile mobs or working out a smart mining system. At the end of the journey, however 
                    you have chosen to play Minecraft, you will have your very own story that goes with it. We love 
                    hearing them, and we hope that Trails & Tales will encourage you to tell even more Minecraft 
                    stories that you can share with the world!  </p>
